This is the main project in the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)": https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING

It is programmed following the lectures, but I have reformatted several things on my own:
- instead of using Vue2, I have used the Vue3
- instead of using options API setup, I have used the composition API
- instead of using JavaScript, I have used TypeScript
- instead of using Vuex state management, I have used Pinia
- I have reformatted the router setup to using routes as constants, which also makes working with routes different from the course project

I have used the following technologies in this project:
- Vue3
- Composition API
- TypeScript
- Pinia
- Vue Router

I have been working in IntelliJ IDEA, also using:
- ESLint
- GitHub CoPilot

I haven't been focusing on the design in CSS, so this is just copy-paste from the course project.
